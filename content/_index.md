modo arsit? Utinam rapta fiducia valuere litora _adicit cursu_, ad facies

<!-- ## Suis quot vota

Ea _furtique_ risere fratres edidit terrae magis. Colla tam mihi tenebat:
miseram excita suadent es pecudes iam. Concilio _quam_ velatus posset ait quod

## What is this?
Ideally, this would be the place for a quick reference on definitions, "how to's", and examples. Think of it as a cookbook, it shows you how to do something step-by-step (no steps skipped) I will try my best to update this site after each lecture. If you would like to contribute, you are more than welcome to!

You can expect to see:
- Clean and concise notes
- Helpful websites
- Tutorials

## What this is not
This is not a Piazza! This is simply a documentation of what you learned from lecture.

## Contribute!
The notes are written in markdown and we are using [KaTex](https://katex.org/) for mathematical expressions.
