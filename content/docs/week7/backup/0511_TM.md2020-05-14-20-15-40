## Definition
A Turing Maching is a 7-tuple  $(Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)$ where:
- Q is a finite set of **states**
- $\Sigma$ is a finite **input alphabet** (not containing the blank symbol _ )
- $\Gamma$ is a **tape alphabet** (with _ $\in\Gamma$ and $\Sigma \subset \Gamma$)
- $\delta : Q \times \Gamma ->Q\times\Gamma\times\{L,R\}$
		- $Q$: Current state
		- $\Gamma$: symbol at head
		- >
		- $Q$: Next state
		- $\Gamma$: Symbol to write at head
		- $\{L,R\}:$ Direction to move the head
- $q_0 \in Q$ is the **start state**
- $q_{accept} \in Q$ is the **accept state**
- $q_{reject} \in Q$ is the **reject state** ($q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}$)

Note: Various changes to this definition does not change the power of the TM.
1. Allowing the head to stay in place
2. having more than one tape (ex: a separate "work tape" to avoid overwriting the input)

## Definition
A configuration of a TM is a triple (x,q,y) written *xqy* where:
- $x \in \Gamma^*$ is the contents of the tape to the left of the head
- $q \in Q$ is the current state
- $y \in \Gamma^*$ is the contents of the tape which includes the head and everything to the right of it
