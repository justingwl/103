## Pumping lemma for context free grammars
### Theorem
If $\forall P \geq1$, $\exists w \in L$ with $|w| \geq P$ s.t for all decompositions w=uvxyz with $|vxy| \leq P$  and $|vy| \geq 0$, there is some $k \geq 0$ $uv^kxy^kz$ $\notin$ L, then L is not regular.

> In other words, there exists a pumping length $P$ that is greater than 1. For all strings w that is in the language L with a length |w| greater than p, you can split into 5 parts $w = uvxyz$ in a way that the following must be true:
> 1. $vy$ cannot both be empty
> 2. The length of $vxy\leq P$
> 2. $uv^ky^kz$  is in the language L for every $k$


### Steps to prove that a Language is not Context Free (Contrapositive):
 1) Adversary picks an arbitrary $P \geq 1$
2) You design a string $w\in L$ with $|w| >= P$
3) Adversary splits $w=uvxyz$ with $|vy| >= 0$ and $|vxy| \leq P$
4) You pick k >= 0 such that $uv^ky^kz \notin L$ 

If you can always do this, then L is not context free.

#### Example 1 of pumping lemma 
$A = \lbrace0^n1^n2^n \vert n >= 0\rbrace = \lbrace \epsilon, 012, 001122, 000111222\rbrace$
Proof:
1) **Adversary picks an arbitrary $P \geq 1$**
2) **You design a string $w\in L$ with $|w| >= P$**
	We pick a string $w$ according to the pumping length P that the adversary picked.
	Pick $w = 0^P1^P2^P$ 
3) **Adversary splits $w$ into 5 parts, $w=uvxyz$, while following the rules below:**
	- $|vy| > 0$
	-  $|vxy| \leq P$
	
	**Note:**  **You cannot pick P, the adversary picks P.** But for illustration purposes, let $P = 3$. The resulting string $w$ = 000111222
	Because $|vxy| \leq P \leq 3$ , $vy$ cannot contain both 0,1,2 simultaneously. 
	Furthermore, because $|vy| \geq0$,  either $v$ or $y$ must contain a character. There are no restrictions on $u$ and $z$
	Here are a few possible ways this string $w$ can be split, there are many more:

|cases|u|v|x|y|z
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|000|1|1|1|222|
|2|00011|1|2|2|2|
|3|0|0|0|1|11222|
|4|000||1|11|222|
|5|000|1|11||222|
|6|0001|1|1||222|
|7|0001|11|||222|
|8|00011|1|||222|
|9|000111|2|2|2||
|10|00011122|||2||
|11|00011122|2||||

4) **You pick k >= 0 such that $uv^ky^kz \notin L$**
	Let $k=2$, then

	For example, apply $k=2$ to case 1
	
	For each of these above cases, if you apply $k=2$,   $uv^2xy^2z \notin L$

|cases|u|$v^2$|x|$y^2$|z
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|000|11|1|11|222|

To generalize this, you can say that $uv^ky^kz$ is not in the language L because we cannot simultaneously increase 0,1,2 $k$ which means we get a different number of 0's, 1's, or 2's
